# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

Louise owns Kickstarter, a crowdfunding platform that funds and supports various campaigns all over the world. We were provided data that 
included approximately 4,115 different campaigns. An initial look at the data
focused on parent categories to examine the makeup of successful campaigns. Theatre was by far the most
successful, followed by music, then film & video. Food and games were both plagued by high failure rates.

Comparing the various campaign sub-categories based their outcome reveals the sheer number of plays is significantly higher than any other 
sub-category. They are also the most successful campaigns, when considering the number of successful campaigns. Some other notable successful campaigns 
are documentary, hardware, and rock.

We also looked at outcomes based on their launch date to see if there was any correlation between the month the campaign launched and the 
success of the campaign. It was noted that there is a sharp spike in successful campaigns in the spring, leading up to summer, before steadily declining during the winter months.
This would indicate that summer campaigns are more successful than winter campaigns. See chart Outcomes Based on Launch Date.

Another metric that we examined was the length of fundraising campaign and it's correlation to the campaign's success. We were able to 
gain insight on whether campaign length might be tied to its outcome. 

Since they were the most successful, we decided to look at theatre and plays to get a deeper understanding of the most successful campaigns.
