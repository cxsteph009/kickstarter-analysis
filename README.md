# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

Kickstarter, like other crowdfunding platforms, allows project creators to add incentives for different pledge amounts. 
We can help Louise set up her incentives by first determining how much money people have pledged to campaigns historically. Is it $3? $10? Even \$50? 
Louise would benefit from additional visualization of the data so that she can see the outcomes of all the categories.

Refer to the GitHub Help page (https://docs.github.com/en) for additional information about creating documentation using markdown format.

In addition to your findings, you should also include charts and graphs (visualizations) in your report.
---Visualizations help communicate the story the data is telling by making it more understandable and coherent. 
At the end of the report, add any recommendations you have for Louise based on your findings.
