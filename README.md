# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends

Louise owns Kickstarter, a crowdfunding platform that allows project creators to add incentives for different pledge amounts. 
My goal is to help Louise set up her incentives by first determining how much money people have pledged to campaigns historically. 
Is it $3? $10? Even \$50? 

Louise would benefit from additional visualization of the data so that she can see the outcomes of all the categories.

Include charts and graphs (visualizations) in this report.
---Visualizations help communicate the story the data is telling by making it more understandable and coherent. 
At the end of the report, add any recommendations you have for Louise based on your findings.

Refer to the GitHub Help page (https://docs.github.com/en) for additional information about creating documentation using markdown format.
